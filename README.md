This is a Power Point slide deck I've prepared as a brief overview of international trade activities in the Houston/Galveston district. 
It is saved in .ppsx format and thus, directly opens to the presentation. File contains custom-made animations, so every click reveals
a new portion of each slide. Comments and recommendations welcome!
