This is a PowerPoint slide deck I prepared as a brief overview of **international trade activities** in the **Houston/Galveston district**. 
To view the content, download the file. It is saved in `.ppsx` format and thus, directly opens to the presentation. File contains custom-made animations, so every click reveals
a new portion of each slide. 

Comments and recommendations welcome!
